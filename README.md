# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Initial variable x2,y2,x1,y1 and assign the value to the variable
### Step 2: 
Then initial variable d
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  
![](./formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Round  of the value d to two decimal
### Step 5: 
Print the value d
### PROGRAM:
```py

def distance(x1,y1,x2,y2):
    d=((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)**0.5
    return round(d,2)
x1=4
y1=2
x2=10
y2=6
print(distance(x1,y1,x2,y2))
```
  

### OUTPUT:
